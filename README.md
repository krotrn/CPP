# Learning DSA in C++

Welcome to my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++. This repository is a personal project where I commit to learning and improving my DSA skills every day. I aim to update this repository regularly with new concepts, code snippets, and challenges I've tackled.

## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental to improving problem-solving skills and understanding computational efficiency. My goal is to master these concepts in C++ due to its performance advantages and its close relationship with system-level resources.

## Topics Covered

### Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Static and dynamic arrays, and their applications.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists; basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Stacks**: Implementation and usage scenarios.
- **Queues**: Different types such as circular and priority queues.
- **Heap**: Max and min heaps; applications in priority queues and heapsort.
- **HashMap**: Efficient key-value storage, collision handling, and usage in various algorithms.
- **Sets**: Unordered and ordered sets, operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- **Trees**: General trees, binary trees, and traversal techniques (preorder, inorder, postorder).
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: Operations like insertion, deletion, and searching in a BST.

### Algorithms

- **Sorting and Searching**: Bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, linear search, binary search.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Problem-solving strategies that build up a solution step by step, making locally optimal choices.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**(currently Learning): Techniques to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, focusing on overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Mastering OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in C++ for better modularity and code reuse.

This journey is ongoing, and I plan to explore more advanced topics and dive deeper into optimizing solutions.

## Learning Resources
