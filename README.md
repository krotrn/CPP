# Learning DSA in C++

Welcome to my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++. This repository is a personal project where I commit to learning and improving my DSA skills every day. I aim to update this repository regularly with new concepts, code snippets, and challenges I've tackled.

## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental to improving problem-solving skills and understanding computational efficiency. My goal is to master these concepts in C++ because of its close relationship with system-level resources and its performance advantages.

## What I've Learned Till Date

Till now, I have covered a variety of topics in both data structures and algorithms. Below is a brief overview:

### Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Understanding static and dynamic arrays, and their applications.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists, and implementing basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Algorithms

- **Sorting and Searching**: Bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, linear search, and binary search.

This journey is ongoing, and I plan to delve deeper into each of these topics, exploring more complex problems and efficient solutions.

## Resources

I've been utilizing a variety of resources for learning, including online courses, textbooks, and coding platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank. Some notable mentions are:

- [C++ Documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
- [Decode DSA with C++ 2.0](https://www.pwskills.com//)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Conclusion

This repository not only serves as a log of my learning journey but also as a resource for anyone interested in mastering DSA in C++. I hope it inspires and aids others in their learning paths.
